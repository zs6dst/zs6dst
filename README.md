## Skills: C# / C / SQL / Python / Go / Assembly

- I live in South Africa.
- I started learning computer programming in school using assembly language. Then we learned Fortran and COBOL. At university, we used punch cards to write PL/1 programs.
- I learned C in my first job. I fell in love with the power of the language. It was like coding in assembly, but with an editor ;-)
- For a while, I programmed in [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_syntax_and_symbols).
- Moving on, I used Turbo Pascal. This was also my first experience working with databases. At the same time, I discovered dBase. (Does anyone even remember that?)
- C was my tool for a few years, before moving to Visual Basic. Love it, or hate it, it was a very productive tool. This was my first job working in a large team in a corporate environment. It was quite a change in mindset to develop software in a team - this is experience which you cannot learn from bootcamps and certifications.
- I got interested in Linux around 2000. I first installed Corel Linux on a 486, before settling on Debian. Another mindblowing experience watching a PC boot up in a terminal after working on Windows for a few years. I even got my Linux Level 1 certification.
- Talking about certifications: I am a certified Project Manager. Never really used it professionally, but I've met PMs that could do with some certification training...
- My intro to .NET was with VB.NET, which fortunately lasted only a month or so, before management realised their mistake and changed to C#.
- I am proud that I wrote one, **and only one** Java program in production. No COBOL ever.
- I had a baptism of fire with *bash* scripting on UNIX when I had to extract data from archives which took weeks. *bash* rocks!
- For the last 15 years I have been using mainly C# professionally, developing backend services in the telecoms and banking industries. A large portion of this was to interface with external systems like SAP, web services and APIs.
- I love Python. I also never want to write a system in it. 
- Currently, I am learning Go. I **love** the simplicity and power which reminds me of C. I **really** hope that it becomes mainstream and that I can use it professionally.
- I had a brief flirt about 20 years ago attempting to write assembly programs for PIC chips. Since Arduino, my first love for assembly and embedded systems was rekindled. My [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/zs6dst/FizzBuzz) project combined my fascination with 7-segment displays, logic chips, C and steampunk electronics in a novel [device](https://github.com/zs6dst/FizzBuzz/issues/2). Creating the [NightLamp](https://github.com/zs6dst/NightLamp) project entirely in assembler was a blast from the past!
- I achieved the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and I am currently preparing for the AWS Solution Architect Associate certifications.
